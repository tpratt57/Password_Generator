This repository contains a deployed web apllication that will randomly generate a password base off of user input Variables contain, numbers, letter both upper and lowercase, along with special characters User can pick a password length of 8 to 128 characters 

For what ever reason, I cannot figure it out and I'm about to have a breakdown, my personal index.html will not function properly, it is not accepting any references to script.js or style.css amd just flat out will not work. However, in friendly-parakeet index.html works just fine with all the code I added. I don't know what is going on, I feel like ripping my hair out.
